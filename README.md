**Codeverse** is an open-source social-coding platform that unifies posting, discovery, direct messaging, and knowledge-sharing in a single, distraction-free workspace.  
Its mission is to shorten the distance between *idea* and *implementation* by giving developers—​from beginners to seasoned mentors—​everything they need to collaborate and grow, without context-switching across 
dozens of tools.


**Key Features**

 **Powerful Search**   Full-text + tag search with a dedicated results page and quick-access search in the sidebar. |
 **Request-Based Messaging**   “Message” button on every profile opens a dialog → receiver approves or blocks → chat appears in both users’ **Messages** page. |
 **Community Q&A**  Ask questions, browse by tag, vote on answers, and mark the best one. |
 **Notifications**  Toast + inbox notifications for message requests, approvals, answers, and mentions. |
 **Responsive UI**  Built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui for a clean, accessible design. |
